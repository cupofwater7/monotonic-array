# monotonic-array

Difficulty: medium

  Write a function that takes in an array of integers and returns a boolean
  representing whether the array is monotonic. An array is said to be monotonic if its elements, from left to right, are
  entirely non-increasing or entirely non-decreasing. Non-increasing elements aren't necessarily exclusively decreasing; they simply
  don't increase. Similarly, non-decreasing elements aren't necessarily
  exclusively increasing; they simply don't decrease. Note that empty arrays and arrays of one element are monotonic.
